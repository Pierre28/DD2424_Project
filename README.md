# DD2424_Project

During this project we want to explore the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), through the generation of bird images, based on the Caltech-UCSD Birds dataset. Gans were introduce by Goodfellow et al., in 2014, giving rise to a whole new field of research.
We would rely mainly on the work done by  Radford et al., who introduced the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversial Model.

To achieve this objective, we plan to use the Python Tensorflow library as it is well documented and adapted to solve Deep Learning problems.
