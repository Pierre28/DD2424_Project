# DD2424_Project

Final project for the Deep Learning class at KTH, 2018.

During this project we explored the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), through the generation of various images (MNIST, CIFAR). 
The present project relies mainly on the work done by  Radford et al., who introduced the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversial Model.
